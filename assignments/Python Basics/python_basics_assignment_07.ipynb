    "Raw strings are often used in Regex objects because regular expressions frequently contain backslashes (\\) and other special characters, which have special meanings in Python string literals. By using raw strings (denoted by the prefix r), Python interprets the backslashes in a regular expression as literal backslashes, rather than escape characters. This means that you can include backslashes in your regular expressions without having to escape them with additional backslashes, which can make the expression easier to read and understand."
