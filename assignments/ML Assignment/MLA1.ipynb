    "The best machine learning model to make a robot walk through various unfamiliar terrains is reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that allows an agent to learn how to behave in an environment by trial and error. The agent is rewarded for taking actions that lead to desired outcomes, and penalized for taking actions that lead to undesired outcomes. Over time, the agent learns to take actions that maximize its rewards."
